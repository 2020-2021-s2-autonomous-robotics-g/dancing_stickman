# dancing_stickman
# [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/get-started/user-guide/python/) Exploration

This is a repository that makes a stickman dance to music

## Who:

Developed by Beckett and Emi

## What

We made a stickman dance back and forth to music.

## How

We used the micro:bit capabilities to animate a stickman we created using the lights, back and forth by making two images we created of the stckman in different possitions alternate. We also imported music from the microbit site wich plays when the stickman dances.

## Why

We made the design choices we made because we wanted to make an animation since the begining and when we learned all of the music we can play, we decided to make a dancing stickman.
